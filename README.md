# Logical Operations HomePage Clone

This repository contains the code for a simple website clone built entirely with HTML and CSS. 
This project showcases my HTML and CSS skills by recreating an existing website. 

## About the Project
This project is a clone of [Logical Operations](https://logicaloperations.com/). 
It focuses on replicating the basic layout and visual style of the original website using HTML for structure CSS for styling and media queries for responsiveness.

Note: This is a basic clone and may not include all the functionalities of the original website.
